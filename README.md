# u_maryland

Demo project for the University of Maryland's Google Developer Student Club meeting on Friday April 28, 2023.

## Getting Started

If you've never used Flutter before, check out these resources to get started:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Fish and Flutter

One simple way to get started with Flutter on macOS is to use the Fish and Flutter method described in this [blog post](https://mayjuun.com/blog/06-fish-and-flutter/). Essentially, this will allow you to just use Homebrew to get everything loaded (either via Flutter directly or fvm, if you need to use different Flutter packages).

## Widgetbook

Some of the items shown in this demo harness Widgetbook version 3, which thus far has limited documentation and examples. Given how useful these packages are, we are including these packages in this 'getting started' template.

## Images

Images used in this example app were created using MidJourney and are available in the Creative Commons space.
